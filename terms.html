                <br>

                1. We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Trading Sphere
                service for any reason, without notice at any time.
                <br>
                2. We reserve the right to alter these Terms of Use at any time. If the
                alterations constitute a material change to the Terms of Use, we will
                notify you via internet mail according to the preference expressed on
                your account. What constitutes a &quot;material change&quot; will be
                determined at our sole discretion, in good faith and using common
                sense and reasonable judgement.
                <br>

                3. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at

                <br>
                5. We may, but have no obligation to, remove Content and accounts
                containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion are
                unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene or
                otherwise objectionable or violates any party&#39;s intellectual property or

                <br>
                6. We reserve the right to reclaim usernames on behalf of businesses

                <br>
                <h6>Proprietary Rights in Content on Trading Sphere</h6>
                1. Trading Sphere does NOT claim ANY ownership rights in the text,
                files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of
                authorship, applications, or any other materials (collectively,
                &quot;Content&quot;) that you post on or through the Trading Sphere Services.
            
                By displaying or publishing (&quot;posting&quot;) any Content on or through the
                Trading Sphere Services, you hereby grant to Trading Sphere a non-
                exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to
                
                use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display,
                reproduce and translate such Content, including without limitation
                distributing part or all of the Site in any media formats through any
                media channels, except Content not shared publicly (&quot;private&quot;) will
                not be distributed outside the Trading Sphere Services. 
                <br>
                2. Some of the Trading Sphere Services are supported by advertising
                revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you
                hereby agree that Trading Sphere may place such advertising and
                promotions on the Trading Sphere Services or on, about, or in
                conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such
                advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific
                notice to you.
                <br>
                3. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by
                you on or through the Trading Sphere Services or otherwise have the
                right to grant the license set forth in this section, (ii) the posting and
                use of your Content on or through the Trading Sphere Services does
                not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract
                rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person,
                and (iii) the posting of your Content on the Site does not result in a
                breach of contract between you and a third party. You agree to pay
                for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by
                reason of Content you post on or through the Trading Sphere
                Services.
                <br>
                4. The Trading Sphere Services contain Content of Trading Sphere
                (&quot;Trading Sphere Content&quot;). Trading Sphere Content is protected by
                copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and
                Trading Sphere owns and retains all rights in the Trading Sphere
                Content and the Trading Sphere Services. Trading Sphere hereby
                grants you a limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to
                reproduce and display the Trading Sphere Content (excluding any
                software code) solely for your personal use in connection with
                viewing the Site and using the Trading Sphere Services.
                <br>
                5. The Trading Sphere Services contain Content of Users and other
                Trading Sphere licensors. Except as provided within this Agreement,
                you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit,
                distribute, perform, display, or sell any Content appearing on or
                through the Trading Sphere Services.
                <br>
                6. Trading Sphere performs technical functions necessary to offer the
                Trading Sphere Services, including but not limited to transcoding
                and/or reformatting Content to allow its use throughout the Trading
                Sphere Services.
                <br>
                7. Although the Site and other Trading Sphere Services are normally
                available, there will be occasions when the Site or other Trading
                Sphere Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or
                upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of
                telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the control
                of Trading Sphere. Also, although Trading Sphere will normally only
                delete Content that violates this Agreement, Trading Sphere reserves
                the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice.
                Deleted content may be stored by Trading Sphere in order to comply
                with certain legal obligations and is not retrievable without a valid
                court order. Consequently, Trading Sphere encourages you to
                maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Trading
                Sphere is not a backup service. Trading Sphere will not be liable to
                you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the
                Trading Sphere Services, or the loss of any Content.

                <br>
                <h4 style="color: black;">FEES AND PAYMENT</h4>
                <br>
                The basic Service is free to users, but if User elects to upgrade to a
                subscription membership or any of our other paid features, the following
                terms below shall apply. Trading Sphere reserves the right to change its
                prices at any time.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h6 style="color: black;">A. Billing and Payment</h6>
                <br>
                Trading Sphere bills users through an online account for use of the
                Service. User agrees to pay Trading Sphere all applicable Service fees
                using this online account. All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes (e.g.
                sales, use, or value-added tax), unless otherwise stated, and User is
                solely responsible for the payment of any such taxes that may be
                imposed on your use of the Service. Trading Sphere may correct any
                billing errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or
                received payment. Trading Sphere reserves the right to change its
                prices for certain Service features - and to institute new charges at any
                time - upon notice to you, which may be sent by email or posted on the
                Site. User agrees to maintain current, complete and accurate information
                for User&#39;s billing account. In addition, User authorizes Trading Sphere to
                obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for
                User&#39;s credit or debit card as provided by User&#39;s credit or debit card
                issuer. All fees are final and nonrefundable (including in the event any
                features or functions of any service that User has subscribed to are
                changed, modified, diminished or removed). User shall be responsible
                for any applicable foreign transaction fees charged by User&#39;s bank.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h6 style="color: black;">B. Automatic Renewal</h6>
                <br>
                User&#39;s subscription to the Service will continue indefinitely until cancelled
                by User (via the cancellation mechanisms provided on the Site). After
                User&#39;s initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent
                subscription period, User&#39;s subscription will automatically continue for an
                additional equivalent period, at the price User agreed to when
                subscribing. User agrees that User&#39;s account will be subject to this
                automatic renewal feature. If User does not wish User&#39;s account to
                renew automatically, or if User wants to change or terminate User&#39;s
                subscription, please log in and go to the Change / Cancel Membership
                page. If User cancels a subscription, User may use such subscription
                until the end of then-current subscription term and the subscription will
                not be renewed thereafter. However, User will not be eligible for a
                prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-
                current subscription period.
                By subscribing, User authorizes Trading Sphere to charge User&#39;s credit
                card, debit card or other payment method at such time and again at the
                beginning of any subsequent subscription period, including any sales or
                similar taxes imposed on User&#39;s subscription payments. Upon the
                renewal of your subscription, if Trading Sphere does not receive
                payment, User agrees that Trading Sphere may either terminate or
                suspend User&#39;s subscription and continue to attempt to charge User&#39;s
                payment method provider until payment is received (upon receipt of
                payment, User&#39;s account will be activated and for purposes of automatic
                renewal, User&#39;s new subscription commitment period will begin as of the
                day payment was received). If User does not terminate User&#39;s
                subscription and/or if User continues to use the Service, User agrees
                that Trading Sphere is authorized to charge the payment method in
                User&#39;s Service account. Trading Sphere may also seek payment directly
                from User. Charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage,
                or as otherwise specified when User initially subscribes to the Service.
                <br>
                <br>

                <h6 style="color: black;">C. Promotions</h6>
                <br>
                Any free trial or other promotion that provides subscriber-level access to
                the Service must be used within the specified time of the trial. User must
                cancel User&#39;s subscription before the end of the trial period in order to
                avoid being charged a subscription fee.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h6 style="color: black;">MEMBER DISPUTES.</h6>
                
                User is solely responsible for your interactions with other Service users.
                Trading Sphere reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor
                disputes between User and other Service users. If User has a dispute
                with one or more users of the Service, User shall and hereby does
                release Trading Sphere (and its officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries,
                joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages
                (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and
                unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
                
               <h6> REGISTRATION; SECURITY.</h6>
                
               As a condition to using certain features of the Service, User may be
                required to register with Trading Sphere and select a password and User
                name (&quot;Trading Sphere User ID&quot;). User shall provide Trading Sphere
                with accurate, complete, and updated registration information. Failure to
                do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, which may result in
                immediate termination of User&#39;s account. User may not (i) select or use
                as a Trading Sphere User ID a name of another person with the intent to
                impersonate that person; or (ii) use as a Trading Sphere User ID a name
                subject to any rights of a person other than User without appropriate
                authorization. Trading Sphere reserves the right, in its discretion, to
                cancel or refuse registration of an Trading Sphere User ID. User shall be
                responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of User&#39;s Trading Sphere
                password and other account information.

                <h6>THIRD PARTY SITES.</h6>

                The Site may permit User to link to other websites or resources on the
                Internet, and other websites or resources may contain links to the Site.
                These other websites are not under Trading Sphere&#39;s control, and User
                acknowledges that Trading Sphere is not responsible or liable for the
                content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other
                aspect of such websites or resources. The inclusion of any such link
                does not imply endorsement by Trading Sphere. User further
                acknowledges and agrees that Trading Sphere shall not be responsible
                or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged
                to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any
                content, goods, information, or services available on or through any such
                website or resource.

                <h6>INDEMNIFICATION.</h6>

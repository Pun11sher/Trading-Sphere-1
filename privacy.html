                information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This

                <h6 style="color: black;">1. Website Visitors</h6>
                <p> Like most website operators, Trading Sphere collects non-personally-identifying information of the
                sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Trading Sphere&#39;s purpose in
                collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Trading Sphere&#39;s visitors
                use its website. From time to time, Trading Sphere may release non-personally-identifying information
                in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
                Trading Sphere also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.tradingsphere.in/ blog
                posts. Trading Sphere only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
                circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
  
                
                <br>
                <h6 style="color: black;">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h6>
                <p>
                Certain visitors to Trading Sphere&#39;s websites choose to interact with Trading Sphere in ways that
                require Trading Sphere to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
                information that Trading Sphere gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask
                visitors who leave a comment at https://www.tradingsphere.in/ to provide a username and email
                address.</p>
              
                
                <br> 
                <h6 style="color: black;">3. Security</h6>
                <p> The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
                  transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
                  commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
                  absolute security.</p>

                
                <br>
                <h6 style="color: black;">4. Advertisements</h6>
                <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                  These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
                  advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information
                  allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of
                  most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Trading Sphere and does not
                  cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
                

                <h6 style="color: black;">5. Links To External Sites</h6>
                <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party
                  link, you will be directed to that third party&#39;s site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
                  and terms of service of every site you visit.
                  We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of
                  any third party sites, products or services.</p>
      
      
                <h6 style="color: black;">6. Trading Sphere uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h6>
                <p>Trading Sphere uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to
                  previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven&#39;t
                  completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in
                  the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display
                  Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone&#39;s past
                  
                  visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and
                  Google&#39;s privacy policy.
                  You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if
                  you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently
                  using a browser plugin.</p>
                

                <h6 style="color: black;">7. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h6>
              <p>
                Trading Sphere discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only
                to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
                information in order to process it on Trading Sphere&#39;s behalf or to provide services available at Trading
                Sphere&#39;s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
                contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Trading
                Sphere&#39;s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Trading Sphere will not rent
                or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than
                to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Trading Sphere
                discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to
                a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Trading Sphere believes in good faith
                that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Trading Sphere, third parties
                or the public at large.
                If you are a registered user of https://www.tradingsphere.in/ and have supplied your email address,
                Trading Sphere may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your
                feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&#39;s going on with Trading Sphere and our products. We
                primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email
                to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
                mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or
                to help us support other users. Trading Sphere takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect
                against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
                personally-identifying information.</p>

                  Trading Sphere identify and track visitors, their usage of https://www.tradingsphere.in/, and their
                  website access preferences. Trading Sphere visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
                  computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Trading Sphere&#39;s websites, with the
                  drawback that certain features of Trading Sphere&#39;s websites may not function properly without the aid
                  of cookies.
                  By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge
                  and agree to Trading Sphere&#39;s use of cookies.</p>

                Those who engage in transactions with Trading Sphere – by purchasing Trading Sphere&#39;s services or
                products, are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and
                financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Trading Sphere collects
                such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&#39;s
                interaction with Trading Sphere. Trading Sphere does not disclose personally-identifying information
                other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
                information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
                activities.</p>
           
                <h6 style="color: black;">10. Business Transfers</h6>
                <p>If Trading Sphere, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Trading
                  Sphere goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
                  transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
                  acquirer of Trading Sphere may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
              
                <h6 style="color: black;">11. Privacy Policy Changes</h6>
                <p> Although most changes are likely to be minor, Trading Sphere may change its Privacy Policy from time
                  to time, and in Trading Sphere&#39;s sole discretion. Trading Sphere encourages visitors to frequently
                  check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in
                  this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
